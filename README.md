# Use-case: R for GIS data processing and analysis
This a showcase R program, which was used for a real-case World Bank's research project, to analyze and process longitudinal GIS data on the overtime groundwater levels across India (per village, per state and per season analysis).

#### Outputs
the codes output the graphs in a spereate pdf, which is also inclued in this folder, namely <<>>. 

#### Research purpose
The purpose of this research project was to look into overyears (and perseason) groundwater levels acrros India (states and villages), attempting to understand how these chnages affected farming and farmers practices, and crops yields. The Key objective was to associate these changes to policy recommendations for rural development and farmers wellbeing. 

- R was the primairy language used for the assignment
- Raster data on wells distrbuted accross india was utilized
- The R script process and visualize raster data and shape files to produce relevant descriptive and analytical graphs and maps
- Further processing and regression analysis was done through Stata (not included in this project's folder)

#### [Notes to users]
I am putting this code as a show case, however, it is a functional code, though doesnt include a lot of a typical explanatory texts as what a user would expect from and educational project. The user however are free to use and tweak the codes to fit their needs.
- I stopped mainining the codes in 2022, so always be warry of package and sytanx updates
