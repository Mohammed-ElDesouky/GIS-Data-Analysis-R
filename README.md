# Use-case: R for GIS data processing and analysis
This a showcase R program, which was used for a real-case World Bank's research project, to analyze and process longitudinal GIS data on the overtime groundwater levels across India (per village, per state and per season analysis).

#### Outputs
the codes output the graphs in a separate pdf, which is also included within this folder, namely <<02_Outputs_analysis_graphs>>. 

#### Research purpose
The purpose of this research project was to look into over years (and per-season) groundwater levels across India (states and villages), attempting to understand how these changes affected farming and farmers practices, and crops yields. The Key objective was to associate these changes to policy recommendations for rural development and farmers wellbeing. 

- R was the primary language used for the assignment
- Raster data on wells distributed across India was utilized
- The R script process and visualize raster data and shape files to produce relevant descriptive and analytical graphs and maps
- Further processing and regression analysis was done through Stata (not included in this project's folder)

#### [Notes to users]
I am putting this code as a show case, however, it is a functional code, though doesnâ€™t include a lot of a typical explanatory texts as what a user would expect from and educational project. The users are however free to use and tweak the codes to fit their needs.
- I stopped mainlining the codes in 2022, so always be warry of package and syntax updates
